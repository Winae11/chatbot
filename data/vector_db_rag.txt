Vector Databases and RAG Explained

What is a Vector Database?

A vector database is a specialized database designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors (embeddings). Unlike traditional databases that store structured data in rows and columns, vector databases optimize for similarity search operations on vector embeddings.

Key Characteristics:
- Stores and retrieves high-dimensional vector embeddings
- Supports fast similarity search using vector distance metrics
- Enables semantic search based on meaning rather than keywords
- Scales efficiently to millions or billions of vectors
- Supports filtering and metadata association with vectors

Vector Embeddings:
Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or other data in a high-dimensional space. They capture semantic meaning and relationships. For example, the word "king" and "queen" would have similar embeddings, while "king" and "table" would be more different.

Popular Vector Databases:
- Chroma: Lightweight, open-source, easy to use
- Pinecone: Managed service with powerful search capabilities
- Weaviate: Open-source with advanced filtering and multi-modal search
- Milvus: Open-source, designed for AI and ML applications
- Qdrant: High-performance, written in Rust
- Postgres with pgvector: SQL database with vector extensions

What is RAG?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that combines information retrieval with language generation to produce more accurate and contextual responses.

RAG Architecture:

1. Document Preparation:
   - Collect and prepare documents
   - Split into chunks for processing
   - Generate embeddings for each chunk

2. Retrieval:
   - User asks a question
   - Convert question to embedding
   - Search vector database for similar document chunks
   - Retrieve top-k most relevant chunks

3. Generation:
   - Pass retrieved documents and question to LLM
   - LLM generates response using context from documents
   - Response is grounded in actual data, not just training data

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in real data
- Allows use of current information without retraining LLM
- Enables knowledge over large document collections
- More interpretable - sources can be cited
- Cost-effective - use smaller LLMs with external knowledge
- Privacy-preserving - sensitive data stays local

Chroma DB:

Chroma is a lightweight vector database optimized for AI applications. It's open-source and designed to be easy to use for developers.

Features:
- Simple in-memory and persistent storage options
- Built-in embeddings generation
- Supports various embedding models
- Easy filtering and metadata management
- Works well with LangChain and other LLM frameworks
- Persistence to disk for recovery

Basic Usage:
```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_google_genai import GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings

embeddings = GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/embedding-001")
vector_store = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    persist_directory="./chroma_db"
)
```

RAG Workflow Example:

1. Load documents (PDFs, text files, web pages)
2. Generate embeddings for document chunks
3. Store embeddings in Chroma
4. User submits query
5. Convert query to embedding
6. Find similar document chunks using vector similarity
7. Pass retrieved chunks + query to Gemini LLM
8. LLM generates contextual answer
9. Return answer with source citations

Use Cases:
- Customer support chatbots answering questions from documentation
- Research assistants searching through academic papers
- Code documentation assistants
- Legal document analysis
- Medical information retrieval
- Product information chatbots
- Enterprise knowledge bases

Advantages Over Traditional Search:
- Semantic understanding rather than keyword matching
- Better handling of synonyms and related concepts
- More relevant results for natural language queries
- Contextual understanding of user intent
